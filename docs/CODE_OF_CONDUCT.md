# Code Of Conduct
> these are the rules and polcies all contributors are expected to follow before commiting anything to the repository


# Obfuscation & Packing

Obfuscating and Packing files to make source code ineligible or difficult to understand is strictly forbidden and doing so will result in your changes being rolled back and you added to a list of "Potentially malicious commiters"

# Modifying Source Code & It's dependencies

Modifying source code that has no apparent issues just to edit it is forbidden, editing source code without proper reasoning other than to make it more verbose or "Longer" only leads to a messy code base I.E "Spaghetti Code"

Modifications to Node dependencies (Packages) are also forbidden this could be directly modifying the packages source code or adding suspicious dependencies without letting others know.

# Sponsors & Self Aadvertisement Or/ Other Promotion

Sponsoring others, yourself or preforming other forms of promotion for any form of finnacial gain or other self centered benefits is forbidden and doing so will result in you being added to the "Potentially malicious commiters" list.

# Loop holes & uncovered rules & topics

Overall just use common sense, if you think others will be upset about it they probably will be, if you think it may break the rules, then it probably does in a way even if it's not directly stated, if you are unsure just ask.

Using loop holes is forbidden and will once again result in you being added to the "Potentially malicious commiters" list.
